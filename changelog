 alpha 1.00.01 -- 2/8/2022 - (An hour or two later...)
- fixed bug where single page discussions would not be scraped as there is no 'last' tag on the page
- fixed bug where comment ids were shifted within the array and generated malformed urls
- updated repo

TODO:
 - fetch comment content from DMs for 1-1 interaction
 - bot functionality (as of now it can only read data, it needs to be able to respond)
 - revize/clean/optimize scraper 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1st alpha release! (alpha 1.00.00) -- 2/8/2022
- implimented the scrape function, which pulls as much useful data from a discussion page as it can.
- added LICENSE, readme.md, and the changelog.
- improved readability of source (it's still terrible code, sorry in advance to anybody who wants to try and figure it out.)
- updated repo

devnote: Scrape() took me about a week and is nowhere near finished, it needs a lot of optimization 
and will definately be revized with coming updates. Scrape() relies on the puppeteer.js and cheerio modules to run.
