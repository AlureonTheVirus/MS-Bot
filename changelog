1st alpha release! (alpha 1.0.01) -- 2/8/2022
- implimented the scrape function, which pulls as much useful data from a discussion page as it can.
- added LICENSE, readme.md, and the changelog.
- improved readability of source (it's still terrible code, sorry in advance to anybody who wants to try and figure it out.)
- updated repo

devnote: Scrape() took me about a week and is nowhere near finished, it needs a lot of optimization 
and will definately be revized with coming updates. Scrape() relies on the puppeteer.js and cheerio modules to run.

TODO:
 - fetch comment content from DMs for 1-1 interaction
 - bot functionality (as of now it can only read data, it needs to be able to respond)
 - revize/clean/optimize scraper
