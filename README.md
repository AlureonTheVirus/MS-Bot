Hia! This is a scraper (and soon to be bot) for Musescore.com written in node.js. So far it can reliably fetch the 
contents of a discussion and parse the output. planned work and the changelog can be found in 'changelog'. As of now
the script is in alpha release 1.0.01. Pull requests are welcome! This is a big project and any and all help is appreciated!

Note: This software is made in good faith. I, Alureon, ask that if any issues 
arise from the use of this software that no blame be placed on my head as the 
creator. I of course can not garentee such a request will be accepted as this 
kind of project seems to be the first of its kind on MS. All I ask is everyone's
utmost patience. 
  
In the meantime, feel free to adapt and use this program however you like!

Thank you!
  ~ Alu.
